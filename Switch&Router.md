## ✅ What is a Router?

A **Router** is a networking device used to **connect multiple networks** and forward data packets between them.

👉 Simply:

> Router connects **Network → Network**

Example:

* Home Network → Internet
* Office LAN → WAN

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Device sends data packet.
2. Router checks **Destination IP Address**.
3. Router decides the **best path** using routing table.
4. Packet is forwarded to the correct network.

---

## 🧠 OSI Layer

* Works at **Layer 3 — Network Layer**

---

## 🔑 Main Functions

* Connects LAN to Internet
* Routes packets between networks
* Performs Network Address Translation (NAT)
* Traffic management
* Security filtering (basic firewall)

---

## 📦 Components Inside Router

* Routing Table
* CPU & Memory
* WAN Port
* LAN Ports
* Wireless Access Point (in WiFi routers)

---

## 👍 Advantages

* Connects different networks
* Provides Internet access
* Improves security
* Supports wireless connectivity

---

## 👎 Disadvantages

* Higher cost than switch
* Configuration required
* Slightly slower than switches

---

## 🏠 Real-Life Example

Home Wi-Fi Router connecting:

* Mobile
* Laptop
* Smart TV
* Printer

## ✅ What is a Switch?

A **Switch** is a networking device used to connect multiple devices **within the same network (LAN)**.

👉 Simply:

> Switch connects **Device → Device**

Example:

* Computer lab network
* Office LAN system

---

## ⚙️ Working Principle

1. Device sends data frame.
2. Switch checks **MAC Address**.
3. Data is sent only to destination port.
4. Other devices do not receive unnecessary traffic.

---

## 🧠 OSI Layer

* Works at **Layer 2 — Data Link Layer**

(Some modern switches work at Layer 3.)

---

## 🔑 Main Functions

* Connects computers in LAN
* Controls traffic flow
* Reduces collision
* Improves network performance

---

## 👍 Advantages

* High speed communication
* Efficient data transfer
* Intelligent forwarding
* Less network congestion

---

## 👎 Disadvantages

* Cannot connect different networks
* Needs router for internet access

---

## 🏫 Real-Life Example

College computer lab where all PCs connect using one switch.

# ⚔️ Router vs Switch

| Feature      | Router             | Switch            |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Connection   | Network to Network | Device to Device  |
| OSI Layer    | Layer 3            | Layer 2           |
| Address Used | IP Address         | MAC Address       |
| Main Purpose | Internet & Routing | LAN Communication |
| Speed        | Medium             | High              |
| Example      | WiFi Router        | LAN Switch        |

Typical Network Flow:

```
Internet
   ↓
Router
   ↓
Switch
   ↓
Computers / Printers / Devices
```

✔ Router connects network to Internet
✔ Switch connects multiple local devices

---

# 🎯 Simple Analogy

* **Router = Post Office** 📮
  → Sends parcel to another city (network)

* **Switch = Office Manager** 🏢
  → Delivers parcel to correct employee (device)

---

# ✅ Conclusion

* Router manages **communication between networks**.
* Switch manages **communication inside a network**.
* Both devices together build modern computer networks.
